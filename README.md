## Technology Choices and Reasons

- **HTML5** – Used for structuring all website pages clearly and semantically.  
- **CSS3** – Used for styling, layout, animations, and responsiveness.  
- **Flexbox** – Used for aligning cards, navigation, and layouts efficiently.  
- **GitHub** – Used for version control and collaboration.

**Reason for not using frameworks:**  
The project focuses on strong fundamentals. Using pure HTML and CSS demonstrates core web development understanding instead of relying on libraries.

## How Future Scalability Is Ensured

- Reusable CSS classes for cards, layouts, and components  
- Consistent design system across pages  
- Modular page structure (separate HTML files for Home, About, Events, Team, News, Achievements, Contact)  
- Clean folder structure (images, icons, styles separated)  
- Responsive design support for mobile and desktop  

This allows:
- Easy addition of new pages  
- Easy styling updates  
- Easy JavaScript integration later
